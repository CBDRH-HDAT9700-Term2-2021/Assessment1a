### Submission instructions
This is an R Markdown document, an example of *literate programming* which allows users to interweave text, statistical output and the code that produces that output. 

To complete your assignment:   

* Edit this file directly, interweaving text and R code as appropriate to answer the questions below. Remember to `Knit` the file to make sure everything is running smoothly. Detailed information on R Markdown is available [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html), and there is a useful cheat sheet [here](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf).  

* Use Git to `commit` changes you make in this repo locally.   

* `Push` the repo, together with this edited `.Rmd` file, the corresponding `.md` file and any other relevant files to GitHub. You can check your rendered file in the GitHub repo---this is how it will apper for the person grading the assessment (note that the output specified at the top of this file is `github_document`. This format is designed to be read within GitHub). Please use appropriate code chunk options to suppress lengthy or superfluous output. 

You should `commit` and `push` as often as necessary! Your assessment will only be graded on the most recent version of your repo at the assessment due date. 

Good luck!

### Overview

In this assignment you are provided with observational data on maternal characteristics and birth outcomes. Your aim is to estimate the **total causal effect** of maternal smoking on birth weight.  

The data come from [Hosmer and Lemeshow (2000)](https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&lr=&id=64JYAwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR13&dq=Hosmer,+D+and+S.+Lemeshow+(2000),+Applied+Logistic+Regression,+Wiley&ots=DtdN7_9plK&sig=aZ7GvUF2VmkhnJsLvg8Cc475Vb4&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false) and include observations on 189 mothers, including information on smoking history, perinatal health and birth outcomes.

This dataset is shipped with the `COUNT` package in R, so you should install this at the console first (we won't use this package, it is just a quick way to load the data into RStudio). You can then load the data into your RStudio environment with the following code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library("COUNT")
data(lbw)
```

To learn more about the dataset and variables you can access the help file for the `lbw` dataframe:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
?lbw
```

### Assessment questions 

(1) Draw a DAG to represent your concepual understanding of the causal relationship between maternal smoking and birth weight. Write a brief descriptive paragraph that highlights any backdoor path(s) and the observed variables that might be useful to close the path(s). (25%)

_Hint: **The DAG should be conceptual, not driven by the available variables in the `lbw` dataset.** Not all variables that appear in the dataset need to be on your DAG and not all nodes that are on your DAG will necessarily be observed variables. You can draw your DAG using whatever tool you prefer. Options include `ggdag()` in R, [daggity.net](http://dagitty.net/dags.html), a screenshot from a DAG drawn in MS Word etc, or even an embedded picture of a DAG drawn with pen and paper._

(2) Match smokers to non-smokers using a matching method of your choice and matching variables that are consistent with your DAG, to the degree that is possible with the available data. Briefly summarise the balance in both cases, drawing on appropriate numerical and graphical summaries. (25%)

(3) Fit the model `low ~ smoke` in (i) The raw data and (ii) the matched data. Briefly describe the model results. How does the estimated effect for smoking change between the two models and how do you interpret this? (25%)

(4) Briefly discuss the limitations of the model 3(ii) and argue whether or not the assumption of exchangeability is likely to hold. (25%)
